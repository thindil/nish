# As the whole the shell <=> the plugin communication is made by the standard
# input and output, all plugin's calls should be done as standard output
# messages, when the plugin should read the shell's API calls as its command
# line arguments for sections calls, like "install" or "enable", or as a normal
# input for any other like "getOption". Also, multiple plugin's calls can be
# done by one printing command, then calls must be separated by new line, or by
# separated printing command, one call per command.
