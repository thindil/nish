 ##
 ## RESULT
 ##
 ## Substraction result of int from ColumnAmount

proc `*`*(x: ColumnAmount; y: int): int {.borrow.}
 ## FUNCTION
 ##
 ## Used to multiply ColumnAmount by int. Borrowed from int type
 ##
 ## PARAMETERS
 ##
 ## * x - The ColumnAmount which will be multiplied
 ## * y - The int which will be multiplier
 ##
 ## RESULT
 ##
 ## The x multiplied by y

proc `==`*(x: ColumnAmount; y: int): bool {.borrow.}
  ## FUNCTION
  ##
  ## Used to compare ColumnAmount with int. Borrowed from int type.
  ##
  ## PARAMETERS
  ##
  ## * x - The ColumnAmount to compare
  ## * y - The int to compare
  ##
  ## RETURNS
  ##
  ## True if both ColumnAmount and int are the same, otherwise false.
