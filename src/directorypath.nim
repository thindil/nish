type DirectoryPath* = distinct string
## Used to store paths to directories

proc `$`*(x: DirectoryPath): string {.borrow.}
## FUNCTION
##
## Get string representation of DirectoryPath. Borrowed from string type.
##
## PARAMETERS
##
## * x - The DirectoryPath which will be converted to string
##
## RESULT
##
## The string representation of x parameter

proc find*(s, sub: DirectoryPath; start: Natural = 0;
    last = 0): int {.borrow.} # Find substring position in DirectoryPath
proc len*(s: DirectoryPath): int {.borrow.} # Get the length of DirectoryPath
proc `&`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): string {.borrow.} # Concatenates DirectoryPath and string into one string
proc `&`*(x: string; y: DirectoryPath): string {.borrow.} # Concatenates string and DirectoryPath into one string
func `!=`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): bool {.gcsafe, raises: [], tags: [],
    locks: 0.} = # Compare the DirectoryPath and string
  return $x != y
func `==`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): bool {.gcsafe, raises: [], tags: [],
    locks: 0.} = # Compare the DirectoryPath and string
  return $x == y
