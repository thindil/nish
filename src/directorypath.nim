type DirectoryPath* = distinct string
## FUNCTION
##
## Used to store paths to directories

proc `$`*(x: DirectoryPath): string {.borrow.}
## FUNCTION
##
## Get string representation of DirectoryPath. Borrowed from string type.
##
## PARAMETERS
##
## * x - The DirectoryPath which will be converted to string
##
## RESULT
##
## The string representation of x parameter

proc find*(s, sub: DirectoryPath; start: Natural = 0; last = 0): int {.borrow.}
## FUNCTION
##
## Find substring position in DirectoryPath. Borrowed from string type.
##
## PARAMETERS
##
## * s     - The DirectoryPath which will be check for the selected character
## * sub   - The character which will be looked for in the DirectoryPath
## * start - The position from which search should start. Can be empty.
##           Default value is 0, start from the beginning of the DirectoryPath.
## * last  - The position to which search should go. Can be empty. Default
##           value is 0, which means no limit.
##
## RETURNS
##
## The position of the character in the DirectoryPath or -1 if character not
## found

proc len*(s: DirectoryPath): int {.borrow.}
## FUNCTION
##
## Get the length of DirectoryPath. Borrowed from int type.
##
## PARAMETERS
##
## * s - The DirectoryPath which length will be count
##
## RETURNS
##
## The length of the selected DirectoryPath

proc `&`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): string {.borrow.}
## FUNCTION
##
## Concatenates DirectoryPath and string into one string
##
## PARAMETERS
##
## * x - The DirectoryPath which will be concatenated
## * y - The string which will be concatenated
##
## RETURNS
##
## The merged DirectoryPath and string into one string

proc `&`*(x: string; y: DirectoryPath): string {.borrow.} # Concatenates string and DirectoryPath into one string
func `!=`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): bool {.gcsafe, raises: [], tags: [],
    locks: 0.} = # Compare the DirectoryPath and string
  return $x != y
func `==`*(x: DirectoryPath; y: string): bool {.gcsafe, raises: [], tags: [],
    locks: 0.} = # Compare the DirectoryPath and string
  return $x == y
